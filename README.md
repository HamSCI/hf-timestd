## Why HF Time Standards?

The system serves a dual purpose:

1. **RTP Mode (with GPSDO):** GPS+PPS provides authoritative timing. The metrology pipeline tests and refines detection algorithms, calibration models, and ionospheric corrections against a known-good reference.

2. **FUSION Mode (without GPSDO):** When GPS, GPSDO, or network access is unavailable, the system derives UTC solely from HF time standard receptions.

FUSION mode addresses real operational scenarios: remote/off-grid installations, disaster situations where GPS and network infrastructure are disrupted, intentional GPS denial, backup timing when GNSS fails, and scientific stations where only HF propagation is available.

**Expected FUSION mode accuracy** (multi-station, typical SDR with TCXO):

| Configuration | Accuracy | Time to Lock |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-station + NTP available | ±2-5 ms | 2-3 min |
| Multi-station, no network | ±2-5 ms | 5-10 min |
| Single station | ±5-15 ms | 2-3 min |

The ionosphere is the dominant error in all cases. Oscillator quality affects time-to-lock and holdover, but not steady-state accuracy once locked. See **[METROLOGY.md](docs/METROLOGY.md)** for the full error budget and analysis.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** ka9q-radio running, Linux with multicast networking, Python 3.11+, HDF5 libraries.

### Production Mode (24/7 Operation)

```bash
# Clone canonical repo (must be reachable by the timestd service user;
# typical layout is /opt/git/hf-timestd, owned by timestd:timestd)
sudo git clone https://github.com/mijahauan/hf-timestd.git /opt/git/hf-timestd
sudo chown -R timestd:timestd /opt/git/hf-timestd
cd /opt/git/hf-timestd

# First-run install (apt deps, user, dirs, venv, services)
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

The install script creates the `timestd` user, installs dependencies, runs the
configuration wizard, sets up an **editable** venv install pointing back at
this repo (Pattern A), and enables services according to the configured
profile. See **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** for details.

### Test/Development Mode

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m hf_timestd daemon --config config/timestd-config.toml
```

### Updating (Pattern A — editable venv install)

```bash
cd /opt/git/hf-timestd
git pull                              # or use deploy.sh --pull
sudo ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

`scripts/deploy.sh` is a small reload script:
1. Refuses to deploy if the working tree is dirty (use `--force-dirty` to
   override). This is the single rule that keeps production from drifting
   away from the git history.
2. Optional `git pull` (`--pull`).
3. `pip install -e .` into `/opt/hf-timestd/venv` — no-op unless
   `pyproject.toml` changed; refreshes entry-point shims.
4. Restarts the units listed in `deploy.toml [systemd]`. core-recorder is
   held back unless `--restart-recorder` is passed (causes a brief data
   gap).
5. Prints the new git SHA.

Because the venv is an editable install, source files in this repo *are*
the production code path. After deploy, `hf-timestd version --json`'s
`git.short` field matches `git rev-parse --short HEAD` here.

### Service Profiles

Which services run is controlled by a **profile** in the config file.
Core-recorder is always on — it is the irreplaceable raw data source.

| Profile | Services | Use case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `archive` | core-recorder, prune | Raw IQ preservation, minimal resources |
| `rtp` | archive + web-api, monitoring, GRAPE | Standard GPSDO timing mode |
| `fusion` | rtp + metrology, fusion, chrony-monitor | GPS-denied timing from HF |
| `full` | fusion + physics, ionex, iono-reanalysis | Full science + timing |

Per-service overrides layer on top (e.g., `metrology = true` in `[services]`
enables metrology for study even in `rtp` profile).

```bash
# View profiles and current state
hf-timestd profile list
hf-timestd profile show
hf-timestd service status

# Switch profile (updates config + systemd)
sudo hf-timestd profile set fusion

# Toggle individual services
sudo hf-timestd service enable metrology
sudo hf-timestd service disable physics
```

### Service Control

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Start all | `sudo ./scripts/start-services.sh` |
| Stop all | `sudo ./scripts/stop-services.sh` |
| Status overview | `hf-timestd service status` |
| **All Logs** | `journalctl -u timestd-* -f` |

### Data Locations

| Data Type | Path |
|-----------|------|
| **Raw IQ** | `/var/lib/timestd/raw_buffer/{CHANNEL}/` (Binary + JSON) |

## Architecture (The Eight Services)

The system is composed of eight independent services that form a pipeline:

```text
[ka9q-radio] (RTP Multicast)
     ↓
1. CORE RECORDER (timestd-core-recorder)
   • Writes Binary IQ (.bin.zst) + JSON sidecars (Reliable Capture)
     ↓
2. METROLOGY (timestd-metrology)
   • Reads Raw IQ -> Detects Tones -> L1/L2 Measurements (HDF5)
     ↓
3. L2 CALIBRATION (timestd-l2-calibration)
   • Applies geometric + ionospheric corrections -> L2 Timing
     ↓
4. FUSION (timestd-fusion) <------- 5. VTEC (timestd-vtec)
   • Reads L2 HDF5 (crash-safe)     • GNSS VTEC monitoring
   • Dual Kalman filtering          • (optional, requires GNSS)
   • Feeds Chrony SHM (TSL1/TSL2)
     ↓
6. PHYSICS (timestd-physics)
   • Carrier-phase dTEC + group-delay TEC validation
     ↓
7. WEB API (timestd-web-api)
   • FastAPI dashboard & REST API (port 8000)
     ↓
8. RADIOD MONITOR (timestd-radiod-monitor)
   • Hardware health monitoring
```

### Key Technologies

- **Binary IQ Archive:** Compressed `.bin.zst` files with JSON metadata sidecars for raw 24 kHz IQ recording. Digital RF (MIT Haystack) is used for GRAPE packaging/upload only.
- **HDF5 SWMR Pipeline:** Single Writer Multiple Reader protocol for all inter-service data exchange. Writer keeps the daily file open (`swmr_mode=True`) and flushes after each append; readers open with `swmr=True`. `h5clear -s` is run unconditionally on every open of an existing file, providing automatic crash recovery without manual intervention.
- **Ionospheric Correction:** GNSS VTEC (primary) and IONEX maps (fallback) correct for group delay ($\tau_{iono} \propto TEC/f^2$). Carrier-phase dTEC is the primary ionospheric science product.

### Recent Updates

**v6.11.0 (March 9, 2026) - Unified Measurement Path + Adaptive Windowing + Multipath-Aware Uncertainty**

- ✅ **Unified detection path** — Eliminated RTP/Fusion fork in `process_minute()`. Both modes now use the same per-second correlator with `BufferTiming` when available; legacy `tone_detector.process_samples()` retained as Fusion fallback only when `BufferTiming` is missing
- ✅ **Adaptive search windows** — Physics-model-derived 3σ uncertainty passed to `_measure_tone_at_known_time()`. Fusion mode adds UTC estimate uncertainty in quadrature: `σ = √(σ_physics² + σ_utc²)`
- ✅ **Window safeguards** in `BroadcastWindowState` — staleness decay (exponential widening after 5 min), consecutive miss counter (resets after 5 misses), model floor rule (tracked variance can only narrow below model at confidence ≥ 0.95 with ≥ 30 observations)
- ✅ **Continuous physics confidence** — Binary physics gate replaced with Gaussian confidence weighting. `FusionTimingState` feeds at confidence > 0.1 threshold, allowing marginal detections to contribute with appropriately low weight
- ✅ **Multipath-aware uncertainty widening** — CLEAN deconvolution delay spread and per-second timing spread inflate `BroadcastWindowState` tracked variance (quadrature). Multipath-affected detections get degraded Kalman confidence
- ✅ **Edge detection in both modes** — Tick edge ensemble now runs in Fusion mode (was RTP-only), enabling edge ensemble recovery and cross-check in all operating modes
- 📄 **Design doc** — `docs/design/UNIFIED_MEASUREMENT_PATH.md` documents the 5-step implementation with adaptive window methodology, failure modes, and safeguards

**v6.10.0 (March 7, 2026) - HDF5 SWMR + Web UI + Robustness**

- ✅ **HDF5 SWMR throughout** — Replaced `open-write-close` + `locking=False` with proper SWMR across all 13 reader/writer sites. Writer keeps daily file open in SWMR mode, flushes after each append. `h5clear -s` called unconditionally on every open-for-write — this is the key fix that makes SWMR robust to unclean shutdowns (previous SWMR attempt abandoned Feb 6 due to this)
- ✅ **32-bit RTP counter wraparound** fix (49.7 hr period at 24 kHz)
- ✅ **Recorder crash-loop prevention** on restart (uptime-gated freshness self-restart)
- ✅ **GRAPE pipeline** robustness: tiered storage search, 2-day retention, non-fatal SFTP upload
- ✅ **GNSS TEC**: correct DCB sign, C1C-C2L synthesis, receiver DCB estimation, plausibility gate
- ✅ **QuotaManager** rewritten: day-level circular buffer deletion with priority ordering
- ✅ **Phase page**: dynamic channel/station filters, solar zenith overlay, gap line breaks
- ✅ **Logs page**: all services grouped with error guidance panel
- ✅ **Dead code archived** from `wwvh_discrimination.py` (3918 → 1237 lines)

**v6.8.0 (February 26, 2026) - Web UI Polish & Physics Service Resilience**

- ✅ **Solar elevation overlay** on ionogram ToF/SNR time series — curve-only, no shading, consistent across all pages
- ✅ **Brighter color scheme** for dark backgrounds — station colors and secondary markers improved on ionogram and dTEC pages
- ✅ **Removed integrated dTEC panel** from dTEC page (rarely detectable, compressed useful plots)
- ✅ **Physics service crash-loop protection** — `_timed_write()` wraps all HDF5 writes with 30s timeout; `_pet_watchdog()` called 17× throughout `process_minute()` to prevent watchdog kills during heavy I/O
- ✅ **Logs API `until` parameter** — enables custom date range queries for journal logs

**v6.7.1 (February 12, 2026) - Propagation Model Full Integration**

- ✅ **Full pipeline migration** - `multi_broadcast_fusion.py` and `bootstrap_validator.py` migrated from `PhysicsPropagationModel` to `HFPropagationModel`

- ✅ **Self-consistency check wired** - `HFPropagationModel.self_consistency_check()` integrated into `ArrivalPatternMatrix`
- ✅ **Deprecated** - `physics_propagation.py` retained for backward compatibility; all callers migrated

**v6.7.0 (February 12, 2026) - Real-Time Ionospheric Propagation Model**

- ✅ **Self-consistency check** - Multi-frequency differential delay validates model TEC predictions
- ✅ **23 new tests** - All passing, 0 regressions in existing test suite

**v6.5.1 (February 7, 2026) - Dual Kalman & Chrony Feed Fixes**

- ✅ **Dual Kalman architecture** - Independent L1 and L2 Kalman filters so TSL1 and TSL2 carry genuinely different estimates to chrony
- ✅ **Chrony SHM reachability fix** - Discontinuity filter no longer permanently latches; threshold scales with measurement uncertainty
- ✅ **HDF5 file lock fix** - Moved `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE` before h5py import; added `locking=False` to all h5py.File() calls
